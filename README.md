## Git Utilities

### `gb-clear`

[Source](./gb-clear.fish)

### `gitc [message]`

[Source](./gitc.fish)

Like `git commit -m` without the need to quote the commit message. This also prefixes the commit message with the branch name.

If no commit message is given and there's only 1 file changed, commit "(Add / Update / Delete) (that file)".

```bash
sharynneazhar at sharynnes-mbp in ~/D/s/nc_integration_service on TF2-661 [!]
â†ª gitc Remove changes for different story
[TF2-661 914690de] TF2-661 Remove changes for different story
 1 file changed, 4 deletions(-)
```

### `wip [message]`

[Source](./wip.fish)

Adds untracked changes and commits them with a WIP message. Additional arguments are added to the WIP message.
